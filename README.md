# SelfDrivingPiCar
The aim of this project is to teach a Smart Car to navigate autonomously on a winding single lane road by detecting lane lines, detect and avoid traffic and to stop at red lights, stop signs, go on green lights, stop to wait for a pedestrian to cross, and change its speed limit according to the posted speed signs,
